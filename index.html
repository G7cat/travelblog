        <div class="content">Bagan (formerly Pagan)is an ancient city and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mandalay Region of Myanmar. From the 9th to 13th centuries, the city was the capital of the Bagan Kingdom, the first kingdom that unified the regions that would later constitute Myanmar. During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries, more than 10,000 Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone, of which the remains of over 2200 temples and pagodas survive. 
        Bagan is the number one attraction in Myanmar – and for good reason – you simply cannot skip it! Home to over 2,000 enchanting stupas spread across the endless countryside, it’s a true feast for the eyes. The best part about Bagan is that, unlike other archaeological sites like it, it’s still fairly untouched by tourists. But it’s catching on, so don’t leave it too long!

        The best way to experience the utter magic of Bagan is by taking a hot air balloon ride at sunrise. There are so many stupas you simply cannot appreciate them all from ground level.

        Pagodas aside, you can explore one of Baga’s local markets – such as the Mani Sithu Market, cycle past the temples on a bike or e-bike, and shop for high-quality lacquer products. And if it’s a foodie experience you’re after, you won’t be disappointed in Bagan; you’ll find no shortage of Asian cuisine here – not just Burmese but Chinese, Thai, Indian, and even Tibetan, so come hungry!

          <div class="content">Inle Lake, a freshwater lake located in the Nyaungshwe Township of Shan State, part of Shan Hills in Myanmar (Burma). It is the second largest lake in Myanmar with an estimated surface area of 44.9 square miles (116 km2), and one of the highest at an elevation of 2,900 feet (880 m). During the dry season, the average water depth is 7 feet (2.1 m), with the deepest point being 12 feet (3.7 m). During the rainy season, this can increase by 5 feet (1.5 m).

          The watershed area for the lake lies to a large extent to the north and west of the lake. The lake drains through the Nam Pilu or Balu Chaung on its southern end. There is also a hot spring on its northwestern shore.

          Large sections of the lake are covered by floating plants. Its clear and slightly alkaline waters (pH 7.8–8) are home to a diverse fauna and many species found nowhere else in the world (endemics). There are more than 35 native species of fish, including 17 endemics. Some of these, notably the Sawbwa barb, red dwarf rasbora, emerald dwarf rasbora, Lake Inle danio, Inle loach and the Inle snakehead, are of minor commercial importance for the aquarium trade. Several fish that are not native have been introduced. Additionally, the lake is home to about 45 species of freshwater snails, 30 of them endemic, along with a small endemic freshwater crab, Inlethelphusa acanthica. It hosts approximately 20,000 migratory gulls in November to January.

            <div class="content">Putao is the northernmost town of Kachin State, Myanmar. It is the principal town in Putao Township. It can only be reached by road during summer and winter as long as it doesn't rain in winter although the road area is tropical and rainfall also very common whole year, but is accessible year round by air if there are sufficient tourist groups to justify a plane. The area around Putao is famous for the variety of endemic birds and rare orchids, which grow naturally. Many orchid lovers are especially attracted by the so-called "Black Orchid" that can be found in the mountains east and west of Putao. Hkakabo Razi and other snow-capped mountains are visible from Putao. Putao also attracts enthusiasts, hiking to Hkakabo Razi base camp, located close to Tahaundam.Geographically, Putao is just over 2000 feet above the sea levels and it is the central town for transportation in far-north towns and villages of Burma. Mount Hkakabo Razi and other snow-capped mountains are visible from Putao. Putao also attracts enthusiasts, hiking to Khakaborazi and other famous summits, located close to Tahaundam and borderline of Burma. The climate of Putao is a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) with very high amount of precipitation throughout the monsoon season. Average temperature in January is 13.1 °C, August is the hottest month with 25.9 °C.

            <div class="content">Pyin Oo Lwin District is a district of the Mandalay Region in central Burma. It lies northeast of Mandalay, with the Myitnge River as its southern boundary. To the east it is bordered by Shan State and in part by the Chaung Magyi (Chaung means stream). It goes north as far as the town of Dakaung where it adjoins Htigyaing Township, Katha District in Sagaing Region. Its western boundary, is for the most part the Irrawaddy, but a very small portion of Thabeikkyin Township is west of the Irrawaddy, near the town of Baw in Sagaing Region. To the southwest it borders Mandalay District.The town began as a military outpost established near a small Shan village with two dozen households on the Lashio-Mandalay trail between Nawnghkio and Mandalay. In 1897, a permanent military post was established in the town and later, because of its climate, it became a hill station and the summer capital of British Burma. The establishment in Burma (civil, commercial and military) would move to Maymyo during the hot season to escape from the high heat and humidity of Rangoon. During British rule and through the 1970s, Maymyo had a large Anglo-Burmese population, but this steadily declined. During the Japanese occupation, as many Anglos were concentrated in and around Maymyo, the Japanese incarcerated many of them for fear of their loyalty to the British very close to Maymyo. Today, Maymyo still has one of the larger populations of Anglo-Burmese in the country. The British named the location Maymyo, literally 'May's Town' in Burmese, after Colonel May, a veteran of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and commander of the Bengal Regiment temporarily stationed in the town in 1887.

               <img  src="https://www.shweyemonhotelmandalay.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/attraction-mandalay.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;margin-left:20px;" class="img-fluid">
              </div>
              <div class="content">The Konbaung dynasty also known as Third Burmese Empire and formerly known as the Alompra dynasty (Alaungphra dynasty) and the Hunter dynasty (Mokso dynasty), was the last dynasty that ruled Burma/Myanmar from 1752 to 1885. It created the second-largest empire in Burmese history and continued the administrative reforms begun by the Toungoo dynasty, laying the foundations of the modern state of Burma. The reforms, however, proved insufficient to stem the advance of the British, who defeated the Burmese in all three Anglo-Burmese wars over a six-decade span (1824–1885) and ended the millennium-old Burmese monarchy in 1885. 
              The Mandalay Palace was constructed as part of King Mindon's founding of Mandalay in February 1857.Large parts of the palace were reconstructed from the palace at Amarapura, which was relocated to Mandalay.The master plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned city, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the centre by Mandalay Hill. The 413-hectare royal palace compound was surrounded by four 2 km (6666 ft) long walls and a moat 64 m (210 ft) wide, 4.5 m (15 ft) deep. Along the wall were bastions with gold-tipped spires at intervals of 169 m (555 ft). The walls had three gates on each side, twelve in total, each presenting a zodiac sign. The citadel had five bridges to cross the moat.

              In June 1857, the construction of the palace began. After the disastrous Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, the shrunken Burmese kingdom had few resources to build a new ostentatious palace. The former royal palace of Amarapura was dismantled and moved by elephants to the new location at the foot of Mandalay Hill. The construction of the palace compound was officially completed on Monday, 23 May 1859.

              The British invaded and ransacked the palace and burned down the royal library. The royal regalia of Burma were removed as military booty and displayed in the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A Museum, London). In 1964 they were returned to Burma as a gesture of goodwill. The British renamed the palace compound Fort Dufferin and used it to billet troops. During World War II, the palace citadel was turned into a supply depot by the Japanese and was burnt to the ground by Allied bombing.

              </div>
              <div class="content">The Hsinbyume Pagoda also known as Myatheindan Pagoda is a large pagoda on the northern side of Mingun in Sagaing Region in Myanmar, on the western bank of the Irrawaddy River.  This white pagoda was built in 1816 by Bagydaw prince who was the heir of King’s Bodawpaya. It was completed three years later in 1819, at the same time as he became the next king of the Konbaung Dynasty.
              The reason why he decided to construct this pagoda is to show his love and to memorialize his first wife’s death during her childbirth in 1812, the Queen Hsinbyume whose name can be understood as White Elephant Queen.
              However, a severe earthquake in 1836 had damaged Hsinbyume Pagoda considerably and it was restored in 1874 by King Mindon.It has a unique architectural style compared to the other pagodas in Myanmar. To complete this all-white pagoda, 100,000 emeralds had been used, that is the reason why it is called Mye (Emerald) Thein Tan (100,000).
              Beside, Hsinbyume pagoda is assumed as the perfect version of the legendary Mount Meru – the mythical axis at the center of the Buddhist cosmos. The pagoda includes seven concentric terraces which represent the seven mountains which rise up to Mount Meru. Some of them contain small mythical creatures such as Ogres, Serpents, or Nagas, and the Nats, or the Spirits.
              The top of the pagoda represents Mount Meru is a gold spire with a Buddha image, which is believed to be designed according to the style of the Chulamanee pagoda.

              Visitors can climb the stairway to the top of the pagoda and see the fabulous views of the other places nearby the pagoda such as the Ayeyarwady River and the Mingun Pagoda.
              Nowadays, it becomes a popular tourist attraction for Buddhist pilgrims who believe the pagoda holds the power to make their dreams come true.

              <div class="content">Mrauk U – once known as Mrohaung – is an abandoned city with strong archaeological importance. While its temples are similar to Bagan’s, they’re smaller and a lot more modern – made from stone instead of brick.

              Surrounded by still-inhabited rural villages, rice paddies, and a panorama of rolling countryside, these temple ruins which were once part of a powerful Arakan kingdom are a sight to behold.

              While Mrauk U was a thriving trading post during the First Anglo-Burmese War, it was relocated to Sittwe after the war ended, leaving Mrauk U behind. Since then, the temples and the city itself have been largely forgotten, left to crumble into dust. The isolation is what makes Mrauk U charming though; only 5,000 tourists make it here every year .A dismissed myth was that in the region where Mrauk U was to be constructed, lived a lonely female monkey. She met a peacock and the two later cohabited. The female monkey conceived with the peacock, and it laid an egg. A human son was born from the egg and he grew up to become a mighty prince. The prince later built a city near the jungle, and in respect of his birth story, the city was called Myauk-U meaning "Monkey's Egg"As Mrauk U and her kingdom prospered, the kings, ministers and peasants built many pagodas and temples around the town to reflect their faith. Thus, Mrauk U houses a rich collection of temples and pagodas second only to the Central Burmese town of Bagan, in Myanmar. Most of Mrauk U's temples were constructed of hewn stone bricks, unlike the mud and clay bricks of Bagan.



              In 2017, an international commission urged Myanmar to nominate Mrauk U for UNESCO World Heritage Site status. The proposal is backed by Kofi Annan and archaeologists are now cataloguing and protecting the city's many sites in preparation for nomination.

          <div class="content">The gorgeous and remote Myeik (or Mergui) Archipelago lies in the Andaman Sea off the coast of southern Myanmar. To visit these extraordinary islands who will need to join a guided tour and they remain largely undiscovered by tourists, which is a big part of their appeal – indeed many of them are inhabitated only by colourful wildlife.

          Made up of more than 800 islands which vary in size from smaller ones with just a few palm trees to larger islands of several hundred square kilometres, the archipelago offers great opportunities for exploration and diving amongst spectacular marine life  and untouched coral reefs, with yachts and cruise boats designed for that purpose.

          It is not just the scenery (under water or over water) that makes the Myeik Archipelago such a fascinating place to visit: the Moken people, also known as the Salone or sea gypsies, are one of the most distinct of Myanmar’s many ethnic groups, living a nomadic, sea-based life here. Having adapted themselves to the water over many hundreds of years, they are the masters of free diving, being able to focus their vision under water and hold their breath far longer than most humans can.
          The islands of the Myeik Archipelago offer a wide variety of sights and adventurous activities, from hiking through tropical valleys to kayaking through mangroves and up rivers; the opportunities for exploration are almost limitless. And if you are after a more laid back time, you can simply jump in the water from your boat or wander along any of the hundreds of deserted white sand beaches.

          A hugely diverse range of wildlife can be found on the islands, including monitor lizards, pythons, civets, chevrotains, gibbons and crab-eating macaques. Up in the air, the colourful diversity is perhaps even greater: you can see hornbills, white-bellied sea eagles, while kites, kingfishers, eastern reef herons, emerald doves, to name but a few of the species that circle the islands

          <div class="content">The Pyu city states were a group of city-states that existed from c. 2nd century BCE to c. mid-11th century in present-day Upper Burma (Myanmar). The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant. The thousand-year period, often referred to as the Pyu millennium, linked the Bronze Age to the beginning of the classical states period when the Pagan Kingdom emerged in the late 9th century. 
          <br> The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on the Culture of Burma and political organisation.[3] The Pyu calendar, based on the Buddhist calendar, later became the Burmese calendar. Recent scholarship, though yet not settled, suggests that the Pyu script, based on the Brahmi script, may have been the source of the Burmese script used to write the Burmese language.The millennium-old civilisation came crashing down in the 9th century when the city-states were destroyed by repeated invasions from the Kingdom of Nanzhao. The Burmans (Bamar) set up a garrison town at Pagan (Bagan) at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers. Pyu settlements remained in Upper Burma for the next three centuries but the Pyu gradually were absorbed into the expanding Pagan Kingdom. The Pyu language still existed until the late 12th century. By the 13th century, the Pyu had assumed the Burman ethnicity. The histories and legends of the Pyu were also incorporated to those of the Burmans.
